Difference between abstract class and interface?

1 interface use interface keyword to define interface block but abstract class is the part of class ,it use abstract keyword.


2 interface modules always will be public abstract class can be default and public both


3 interface contain only constant and abstract method.but abstract class can contain all component of class variable,constant,static,instance excluding only constructor


4 interface method will be implemented into class.but abstract class extend features.hence interface use implements keyword and abstract class use extends keyword

5 interface can be parent of abstract class .abstract class can impelement interface features

6 abstract class can contain main() but interface will never contain main()

7 abstract keyword will be used in abstract class method interface all method will be abstract by default.


8 abstract class abstract method can be default and public both but interface has only contain public method by default.


9 abstract class can not perform multiple inheritance but interface can perform this.


10 interface is only used for set of rules declaration which will be implemented on multiple modules of project.

abstract class is only used to hide actual class features.

what is final class ,final method and final type variable in java?

ans:-

final class can not be inherited but it can contain normal method ,static method and final method.


final class A
{


}
class B extends A
{

}

final method:-  if we want to protect method from method overriding than we can create final method.

final variable:-  if we want to proetct variable from overriding means we want to create constant than we can create final type variable.


final int x;

Exception handing concept in java:-
..............................................................................
Exception means unexpected runtime erros of program by user input,machine or external resource.

Exception and errors both will interrupt the program execution.

error has no protection because it will be raised at compile time.


Exception has protection because it will interrupt program at runtime hence we can secure code under exception block at compile time.

                            Throwable

            Error                                 Exception




Type of Exception:-
1 Checked Exception:-
it is pre-initmated exception some java class use checked exeception to execute java progam.

without exception block program will not compile and execute.


for example if we create file handing program in JAVA than IOException is mandatory.
1 IOException

2 SQLException

3 ClassNotFoundException

4 SerializationException

5 InterruptedException

6 ServletException



2 Unchecked Exception:-

This type of exception will be raised by user input .without exception block program will be compiled and execute.


for example if we enter alphabets in division program than it will throw runtime error.

1 ArithmeticException

2 NumberFormatException

3 ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

4 NullPointerException

5 InputmismatchException

try
{


}
catch(Exception ex)
{


}
