if(condition)
{
   statement1;

  WAP to increase salary of employee from 1000 if entered salary is above 5000 otherwise increase  salary from 2000.




3  nested if--else :-
if more than one condition will be applied in program than we prefer nested or ladder.

nested means more than one if--else statement using nested sequence.

if(condition)
{
      if(condition)
      {

     }
    else
    {

    }

}
else
{
      if(condition)
      {

      }
    else
    {

   }

}

WAP to increase 500 in salary of employee if salary is between 10000 to 25000 ,if salary is less than 10000 than increase 200 and for other's  increase 100.


WAP to check vowel and consonent without using logical?

char ch='a';
String s="";
if(ch=='a')
s="vowel";
else
{  
    if(ch=='e')
      s="vowel";
   else
     {
         if(ch=='i')
         s="vowel";
        else
        {
               if(ch=='o')
                 s="vowel";

                  {
                   
                  }
        }
      }
 

}








 



4  Ladder if--else:-
   it will work step by step means when first condition will be false than second will execute and after third ... and at last else statement will execute.



if(condition)
  statement;
else if(condition)
 statement;
...
...
else
statement;


5 Multiple if:-
we will write more than one if statement

if(condition)
statement
if(condition)
statement
if(condition)
statement
