component of class in JAVA:-

1 Data Member

static:-

it will allocate memory or data space at the time of compilation.
static variable has constant memory means in complete program static has only one memory space.

hence last value of static variable will be contained into memory block.

static datatype variablename;

static will be called by Classname.

static int x;

Classname.x;

it will always use as a shared variable to multiple user's.

all variables which will be declared under static method than it will be by default static.








dynamic:-

this type of variable allocate memory space at runtime using object.

it can create multiple data space  using  object.

we can use single dynmaic variable with multiple values for multiple user's.

in real world programming we always prefer dynamic variable.


datatype variablename=value;

int x=5;

if we declare variable under dynamic method than it is called local dynamic or instance variable.


dynamic variable is also called instance variable because it will be called by object.
